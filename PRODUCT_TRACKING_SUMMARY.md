# Product-Level Click Tracking & Multi-Armed Bandit Implementation

## üéØ Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive product tracking and optimization system that will automatically improve click-through rates on your trending products section.

**Deployment Status:** ‚úÖ **LIVE ON PRODUCTION**

---

## üîç What Was the Problem?

### Before:
- ‚ùå Frontend was sending `productId` in click tracking, but backend was **completely ignoring it**
- ‚ùå Only bundle clicks were being tracked (not individual products)
- ‚ùå Trending products used a static algorithm - same products shown to everyone
- ‚ùå No data on which products actually perform well
- ‚ùå No way to measure CTR (click-through rate)

### After:
- ‚úÖ Full product-level click tracking with detailed analytics
- ‚úÖ Impression tracking for CTR calculation
- ‚úÖ Smart product rotation using multi-armed bandit algorithm
- ‚úÖ Products with high CTR automatically shown more often
- ‚úÖ New admin dashboard to view product performance

---

## üìä What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### Products Table (Enhanced)
```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN:
- clickCount INTEGER DEFAULT 0
- impressionCount INTEGER DEFAULT 0
- lastClickedAt TIMESTAMP
```

#### New Table: product_clicks
Detailed click event tracking:
- productId (which product was clicked)
- source ('trending', 'bundle', 'search')
- bundleSlug (if clicked from a bundle page)
- userAgent (for future personalization)
- referer (traffic source)
- createdAt (timestamp)

### 2. Click Tracking System

#### Updated API: `/api/track-click`
- Now actually tracks individual product clicks!
- Records detailed events in product_clicks table
- Increments product.clickCount
- Updates lastClickedAt timestamp
- Still tracks bundle clicks for backward compatibility

#### Updated Components:
- `TrendingProducts.tsx` - passes `source: 'trending'`
- `ProductCarousel.tsx` - passes `source: 'bundle'`

### 3. Impression Tracking

#### New API: `/api/track-impression`
- Tracks when products are shown to users
- Batch updates impressionCount for all products displayed
- Called when TrendingProducts component mounts

### 4. Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithm

**File:** `lib/db/trending-rotation.ts`

**Strategy:** Thompson Sampling (Bayesian approach)

**How it works:**
1. **Exploitation (70%)**: Show products that have proven high CTR
2. **Exploration (30%)**: Test new products or underexplored products
3. **Recency Decay**: Products clicked recently rank higher (7-day window)
4. **Smart Scoring**: Balances multiple factors

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Final Score = (Base Score √ó 40%) + (CTR Score √ó 40%) + (Recency √ó 20%)

Where:
- Base Score: Commission rates, clickbait keywords, price sweet spot
- CTR Score: Thompson sampling (proven products) or optimistic (new products)
- Recency: Exponential decay over 7 days
```

**Key Features:**
- Products with ‚â•10 impressions: Use real CTR data (Thompson sampling)
- Products with <10 impressions: Optimistic initial values (5% CTR assumed)
- Automatic balancing between showing winners vs testing newcomers
- Prevents "stale" trending products (they decay over time)

### 5. Admin Dashboard

#### New Page: `/admin/products`

Features:
- **Summary Stats**: Total products, clicks, impressions, average CTR
- **Performance Table**: Top 50 products sorted by:
  - Clicks
  - CTR (click-through rate)
  - Impressions
- **Product Details**: Title, price, source (Amazon/Etsy), last click time
- **Visual Indicators**: Green (>5% CTR), Yellow (>2% CTR), Gray (<2% CTR)

#### Added to Sidebar
- New "Products" navigation item with shopping bag icon

## üìà Expected Impact

### Short-term (Week 1-2):
- **Data Collection**: System will gather impression/click data
- **Initial Optimization**: Algorithm starts learning which products perform well
- **Estimated CTR Lift**: 5-10% as obvious losers are deprioritized

### Medium-term (Week 3-4):
- **Full Optimization**: Thompson sampling has enough data
- **Smart Rotation**: Proven winners shown 70%, explorers 30%
- **Estimated CTR Lift**: 15-25% as algorithm finds optimal mix

### Long-term (Month 2+):
- **Continuous Learning**: Always testing new products
- **Automatic Freshness**: Stale products automatically replaced
- **Estimated CTR Lift**: 20-30% sustained improvement

## üîß How It Works (User Flow)

### When a user visits the homepage:

1. **Product Selection** (Server-side):
   ```
   GET /page.tsx
   ‚îî‚îÄ> getTrendingProducts()
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Fetch all products with click/impression stats
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Score using multi-armed bandit algorithm
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Select 12 products (70% proven, 30% explore)
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Shuffle to avoid patterns
   ```

2. **Impression Tracking** (Client-side):
   ```
   TrendingProducts component mounts
   ‚îî‚îÄ> useEffect fires
       ‚îî‚îÄ> POST /api/track-impression
           ‚îî‚îÄ> Increment impressionCount for all 12 products
   ```

3. **Click Tracking** (Client-side):
   ```
   User clicks a product
   ‚îî‚îÄ> handleProductClick()
       ‚îî‚îÄ> POST /api/track-click { productId, source: 'trending' }
           ‚îú‚îÄ> Increment products.clickCount
           ‚îú‚îÄ> Update products.lastClickedAt
           ‚îú‚îÄ> Insert row into product_clicks table
           ‚îî‚îÄ> Fire Google Analytics event
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Open product URL in new tab
   ```

4. **Next Homepage Load**:
   ```
   Server fetches updated click/impression data
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Products with higher CTR get higher scores
   ‚îî‚îÄ> More likely to be selected (70% exploitation)
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Some slots reserved for exploration (30%)
   ```

## üì± Admin Usage

### View Product Performance:

1. Go to: **https://www.goose.gifts/admin/products**
2. See summary stats at the top
3. Sort products by:
   - **Clicks**: Which products get clicked most
   - **CTR**: Which products convert impressions to clicks best
   - **Impressions**: Which products are shown most often

### Interpreting CTR:

- **>5% CTR** üü¢ Excellent performers (show more!)
- **2-5% CTR** üü° Good performers (keep testing)
- **<2% CTR** ‚ö™ Poor performers (will be auto-deprioritized)

### Expected Patterns:

- **First few days**: Low impressions, unreliable CTR
- **Week 1-2**: Data accumulates, patterns emerge
- **Week 3+**: Clear winners/losers, algorithm optimizes

---

## üöÄ Next Steps & Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Recommended):
1. **A/B Test Visual Treatments**:
   - Test larger images on hover
   - Test different price displays
   - Test "Trending" badges

2. **Personalization**:
   - Time-of-day optimization (luxury evening, practical morning)
   - Device-based (mobile vs desktop preferences)
   - Day-of-week patterns (weekend vs weekday)

3. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - CTR by source (trending vs bundle vs search)
   - CTR by device type
   - CTR by time of day
   - Conversion tracking (if Google Ads data available)

### Phase 3 (Advanced):
1. **Multi-Objective Optimization**:
   - Optimize for CTR √ó Commission Rate (revenue)
   - Factor in conversion rate (if trackable)

2. **Contextual Bandits**:
   - Show different products based on user context
   - Learn user preferences over time

3. **A/B Testing Framework**:
   - Compare multi-armed bandit vs static algorithm
   - Measure actual revenue impact

## üìã Monitoring & Maintenance

### What to Watch:

1. **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin/products`):
   - Check weekly for CTR trends
   - Identify consistently poor performers
   - Celebrate high-CTR winners!

2. **Database**:
   - `product_clicks` table grows over time (archive old data quarterly)
   - Monitor query performance as data accumulates

3. **Algorithm Tuning** (if needed):
   - Adjust exploration rate (currently 30%)
   - Adjust recency decay (currently 7 days)
   - Located in: `lib/db/trending-rotation.ts`

### Red Flags:

- ‚ùå Average CTR <1% (something broken)
- ‚ùå All products have 0 impressions (tracking not working)
- ‚ùå Same 12 products always shown (algorithm stuck)

### Green Flags:

- ‚úÖ Average CTR >3% (healthy performance)
- ‚úÖ Product rotation happening (different products in top 12)
- ‚úÖ Clear separation between high/low CTR products

## üéì Technical Details

### Thompson Sampling Explained:

Traditional A/B testing: "Wait until 95% confidence"
Thompson Sampling: "Start optimizing immediately, gain confidence over time"

**How it works:**
1. Model each product's CTR as a Beta distribution
2. Sample from each distribution (adds randomness)
3. Products with high sampled CTR get selected more often
4. As data accumulates, sampling becomes more confident
5. Automatically balances exploration vs exploitation

**Why it's better:**
- No "exploration phase" where you waste traffic on losers
- Automatically increases traffic to winners as confidence grows
- Always leaves room for new products to prove themselves
- Mathematically optimal for maximizing cumulative clicks
