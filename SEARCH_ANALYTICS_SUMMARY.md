# 🔍 Search Analytics System - Ready for Review

## ✅ What's Been Built

I've implemented a complete search analytics tracking and reporting system for goose.gifts. Everything builds successfully and is ready for your review.

---

## 🎯 Core Features

### 1. Database Tracking
- ✅ New `search_queries` table to log every search
- ✅ Tracks: query text, result count, similarity scores, clicks, timestamps
- ✅ Optimized indexes for fast queries at scale
- ✅ Migration file ready: `lib/db/migrations/0002_add_search_queries.sql`

### 2. Google Analytics Integration
- ✅ **Search event**: Fires when user searches (using GA4 standard `'search'` event)
- ✅ **Click event**: Fires when user clicks a product (using `'conversion_event_outbound_click'`)
- ✅ Events include proper metadata (query, product result count, destination domain)

### 3. Admin Dashboard
- ✅ New page: `/admin/search-analytics`
- ✅ Period filters: Last 24 Hours / Last 7 Days / Last 30 Days
- ✅ Quick link added to main admin dashboard

## 📊 Dashboard Sections

### Summary Cards (Top Row)
```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Total Searches  │ Unique Queries  │ Avg Results     │ Click Rate      │ Zero Results    │
│                 │                 │                 │                 │                 │
│     1,247       │      342        │     4.2         │    18.5% ✓      │    12.3% ⚠️     │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Top Search Terms
Shows most popular queries with:
- Search count
- Average results per search
- Click-through rate (color-coded: green/yellow/red)

**Use this to**: See what people are searching for most

### Failed Searches (Content Gaps)
Shows searches with **0 results**:
- Query text
- How many times searched
- When last searched

**Use this to**: Identify what catalog themes/products to add next

### Poor Result Quality
Shows searches with **low similarity scores (<0.6)**:
- Query text
- Search frequency
- Average similarity

**Use this to**: Find queries where results don't match intent well

### Recent Searches
Live feed of last 50 searches:
- Query, results, similarity, clicked status, timestamp

**Use this to**: Monitor search activity in real-time

# OR direct SQL
psql $POSTGRES_URL -i lib/db/migrations/0002_add_search_queries.sql
```

### 2. Verify
```bash
# Check table exists
psql $POSTGRES_URL -c "\d search_queries"
```

### 3. Push to Production
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add search analytics tracking"
git push origin main
```

## 💡 Key Features

### Fire-and-Forget Logging
- Search logging doesn't slow down user experience
- Logs to database asynchronously
- Fails silently if database is down

### Google Analytics Standard Events
- Uses GA4 recommended event names
- `search` - Standard site search event
- `conversion_event_outbound_click` - Outbound affiliate click event
- Properly parameterized for GA4 reporting

### Smart Time Periods
- **Last 24 Hours**: See today's trends
- **Last 7 Days**: Weekly patterns and trending queries
- **Last 30 Days**: Monthly overview and long-term trends

### Optimized Performance
- Database indexes on `created_at`, `result_count`, `clicked`, `query+created_at`
- Fast queries even with millions of search records
- Uses aggregations for summary stats

## 🎓 How to Use

### Daily (5 minutes)
1. Visit `/admin/search-analytics?period=day`
2. Check "Failed Searches" section
3. Pick top 2-3 zero-result queries
4. Add those topics to catalog discovery themes or run targeted prefetch
5. Done!

### Weekly (15 minutes)
1. View last 7 days data
2. Review top search terms
3. Identify low-CTR high-volume queries
4. Improve product titles/descriptions and catalog coverage
5. Track improvement week-over-week

### Monthly (30 minutes)
1. View 30-day trends
2. Compare metrics month-over-month
3. Identify seasonal patterns
4. Plan content creation based on demand
5. Report on search feature success
