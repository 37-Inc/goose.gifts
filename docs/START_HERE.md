## 🎯 Your Next Steps (In Order!)

### Step 1: Read QUICKSTART.md (5 minutes)
```bash
cat QUICKSTART.md
```
This tells you exactly how to get started.

### Step 2: Install & Run (10 minutes)
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OpenAI API key to .env
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test It! (2 minutes)
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Try this example:
   - **Recipient**: "My coworker Sarah loves cats and coffee, makes terrible puns all day"
   - **Humor Style**: Dad Joke
   - **Budget**: $20-$60
3. Click "Find Funny Gifts" and watch the magic! ✨

### Step 4: Get Your API Keys (1-2 days)
You'll need:
- ✅ **OpenAI** (instant) - https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- ⏳ **Amazon PA-API** (48hr activation) - https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/
- ✅ **Etsy** (instant) - https://www.etsy.com/developers
- ✅ **Awin** (2-3 day approval) - https://www.awin.com/

**Pro tip**: Start with just OpenAI to see it work, add others as they're approved!

### Step 5: Deploy to Production (30 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel (free tier is fine!)
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

See `SETUP.md` for detailed deployment instructions.

- Commission per sale: $1.50-2.50

**Example**: 100 gift ideas/day → 5% click through → 10% purchase rate = **$7.50-12.50/day** passive income
